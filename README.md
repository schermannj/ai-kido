# AI-Kido

Extensible, composable and simple AIs.

For now there is only one AI that can play Tic-Tac-Toe with support of Gomoku mode.
But it's optimized only for usual mode. There are still some things to fix, so if you want to help, you can check tests, there you'll find the AI's weak spots that you can fix. Also you can just play with it [here](https://schermannj.github.io/ai-kido-tic-tac-toe-demo/).
